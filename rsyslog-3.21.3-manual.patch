+.SH SELECTORS
+
+The selector field itself again consists of two parts, a facility and a
+priority, separated by a period ('.'). Both parts are case insensitive and can
+also be specified as decimal numbers, but don't do that, you have been warned.
+Both facilities and priorities are described in rsyslog(3). The names mentioned
+below correspond to the similar LOG_-values in /usr/include/rsyslog.h.
+
+The facility is one of the following keywords: auth, authpriv, cron, daemon,
+kern, lpr, mail, mark, news, security (same as auth), syslog, user, uucp and
+local0 through local7. The keyword security should not be used anymore and mark
+is only for internal use and therefore should not be used in applications.
+Anyway, you may want to specify and redirect these messages here. The facility
+specifies the subsystem that produced the message, i.e. all mail programs log
+with the mail facility (LOG_MAIL) if they log using syslog.
+
+The priority is one of the following keywords, in ascending order: debug, info,
+notice, warning, warn (same as warning), err, error (same as err), crit, alert,
+emerg, panic (same as emerg). The keywords error, warn and panic are deprecated
+and should not be used anymore. The priority defines the severity of the message.
+
+The behavior of the original BSD syslogd is that all messages of the specified
+priority and higher are logged according to the given action. Rsyslogd behaves
+the same, but has some extensions.
+
+In addition to the above mentioned names the rsyslogd(8) understands the
+following extensions: An asterisk ('*') stands for all facilities or all
+priorities, depending on where it is used (before or after the period). The
+keyword none stands for no priority of the given facility.
+
+You can specify multiple facilities with the same priority pattern in one
+statement using the comma (',') operator. You may specify as much facilities as
+you want. Remember that only the facility part from such a statement is taken, a
+priority part would be skipped.
+
+Multiple selectors may be specified for a single action using the semicolon
+(';') separator. Remember that each selector in the selector field is capable
+to overwrite the preceding ones. Using this behavior you can exclude some
+priorities from the pattern.
+
+Rsyslogd has a syntax extension to the original BSD source, that makes its use
+more intuitively. You may precede every priority with an equation sign ('=') to
+specify only this single priority and not any of the above. You may also (both
+is valid, too) precede the priority with an exclamation mark ('!') to ignore
+all that priorities, either exact this one or this and any higher priority. If
+you use both extensions than the exclamation mark must occur before the equation
+sign, just use it intuitively.

 .SH ACTIONS
 The action field of a rule describes what to do with the message. In general, message content 
 is written to a kind of "logfile". But also other actions might be done, like writing to a
